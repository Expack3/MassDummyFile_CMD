What is it?

The Mass Dummy File Creator - BAT Edition is a Windows BAT-based console utiliy for replacing files with empty "dummy" files. The utility can optionally back up any replaced files, and can also restore any files which it backed up.

Requirements:

Windows XP or higher

Operation Instructions:

Use the following syntax:

massdummyfilefinal Drive:Path Extension OperationType

Valid OperationType values are 1 (create dummy files), 2 (backup files) or 3 (restore files).

For example, to back up all files in D:\Program Files(x86)\War&Warlords with the extension .dat, you would input the following:

massdummyfilefinal "D:\Program Files(x86)\War&Warlords" .dat 2

Also, if you want to restore backups made using this utility, you do not need to include the extension. For example:

massdummyfilefinal "D:\Program Files(x86)\War&Warlords" 3

and 

massdummyfilefinal "D:\Program Files(x86)\War&Warlords" .bik 3

will do the exact same thing, with the latter ignoring the given extension.

Known Issues:

*If the file you back up contains multiple extensions, such as test.max.xm, backup will fail such that a new file called test.max will be created.

Changelog:

1.0 (Initial Version)

1.01
*Removed @ECHO ON tag from the beginning. This was originally for debugging purposes.
*Changed IF EXIST statement for section Two from checking to see if the original file still exists to whether the file was actually backed up.
